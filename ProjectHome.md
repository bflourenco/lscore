LScore is a program written in Python/Pygtk that generates MIDI files (smf) from the description of L-Systems. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenmayer_systems) Currently it supports the following types of rules:
  * Deterministic
  * Context-sensitive
  * Stochastic
  * Parametric

It also supports genetic operators: crossover and mutation.

We currently don't have a user manual, but there is some information on the wiki. You can also read our article _L-Systems, Scores and Evolutionary Techniques_ [here](http://smc2009.smcnetwork.org/programme/pdfs/229.pdf) =)
